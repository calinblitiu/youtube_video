To use the script just put the files in the file_manager folder in which ever folder you wish to browse and your'e done.


DO NOT make this file available to the public to use as there is nothing from stopping someone from
viewing sensitive info or even deleting files on your server.

Even if you put this script in a folder with no sensitive information people can still inject a path using the where variable
(e.g where=../../).

Enjoy..
